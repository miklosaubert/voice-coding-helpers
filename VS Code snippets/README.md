## VS Code snippets

This folder is a collection of code snippets to make VS Code more voice-friendly. Put them in your snippets folder (on a Mac, this would be in `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets`) or copy and paste excerpts as you see fit.

The `Global.code-snippets` file is intended to be more or less language agnostic, with snippets for very commonly used symbols.
